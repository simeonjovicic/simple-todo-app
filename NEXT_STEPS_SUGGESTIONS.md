## Recommended Next Features (Minimal Resource Use)

### 1. **Edit Functionality** (High Priority)
**Why**: Users need to fix typos and update items
**Resource Impact**: Very low
- Edit todos inline (tap to edit)
- Edit exams (tap exam card to edit)
- Simple, no extra dependencies

### 2. **Search/Filter** (Medium Priority)
**Why**: When you have many todos/exams, finding them is hard
**Resource Impact**: Low (client-side filtering)
- Search todos by title
- Filter exams by subject
- Simple text input, no external libraries

### 3. **Due Dates for Todos** (Medium Priority)
**Why**: Helps prioritize tasks
**Resource Impact**: Low
- Add optional due date to todos
- Show overdue/upcoming todos
- Uses existing date picker component

### 4. **Dark Mode** (Low Priority, Nice to Have)
**Why**: Better for eyes, modern apps have it
**Resource Impact**: Very low (CSS only)
- System preference detection
- Toggle dark/light mode
- Minimal code, no dependencies

### 5. **Swipe Gestures** (Nice to Have)
**Why**: Faster interaction on mobile
**Resource Impact**: Low (Ionic has built-in support)
- Swipe left to delete
- Swipe right to complete
- Uses Ionic's built-in gestures

### 6. **Statistics/Overview** (Optional)
**Why**: See progress at a glance
**Resource Impact**: Low (calculated from existing data)
- Total todos

### 7. **Platform Builds** (When Ready)
**Why**: Use as native app on Mac/Android
**Resource Impact**: Medium (build process)

- Test on both platforms

## My Recommendations (Priority Order)

### Phase 6A: Essential Features

2. **Edit Exams** - Tap exam card to edit
3. **Due Dates for Todos** - Optional due dates

### Phase 6B: Quality of Life
4. **Search Todos** - Find todos quickly
5. **Filter by Subject** - Filter exams by subject
6. **Dark Mode** - System preference + toggle

### Phase 7: Platform Builds

## Features to Avoid (Resource Heavy)
- ❌ Complex animations
- ❌ Heavy libraries
- ❌ Real-time collaboration
- ❌ File attachments
- ❌ Complex analytics
- ❌ Multiple themes
- ❌ Offline sync (unless needed)

## Suggested Next Step

I recommend starting with **Edit Functionality** because:
- Most requested feature
- Very low resource use
- Improves usability significantly
- Quick to implement

Would you like me to implement:
1. **Edit Todos & Exams** (most useful)
2. **Search/Filter** (helps with many items)
3. **Due Dates for Todos** (better task management)
4. **Dark Mode** (nice polish)
5. **Platform Builds** (make it native)

Or something else you have in mind?
