## Getting Started Right Now

### Option 1: Start with Firebase Setup
If you want to set up Firebase first:
1. Open `FIREBASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
2. Follow steps 1-7
3. Come back and we'll integrate it

### Option 2: Start with Basic UI
If you want to see the UI first:
1. We can build the basic todo interface
2. Use local storage initially
3. Connect Firebase later

## Recommended Approach
I recommend **Option 1** - set up Firebase first, then we can build features that connect to it from the start. This avoids refactoring later.

## What's Next?
1. Review the `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for full details
2. Review the `FIREBASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for Firebase setup
3. Let me know when you're ready to start Phase 1, or if you want to begin with a different phase

## Questions?
- Each phase is designed to be testable independently
- We can adjust the design/look at any step
- We'll optimize for minimal resource usage throughout
